#*On Extremal Set Partitions in Cartesian Product Spaces
#@Rudolf Ahlswede[1701837],Ning Cai[2195294],
#!IntroductionConsider (V; E) , where V is a finite set and E is a system of subsets of V . For thecartesian products Vn=Q n1 V and En=Q n1 E let ?(n) denote the minimal size of apartition of Vninto sets which are elements of En, if a partition exists at all, otherwise?(n) is not defined. This is obviously exactly the case if it is so for n = 1 .Whereas the packing number p(n) , that is the maximal size of a system of disjoint setsfrom En, and the covering...

#*The Sandwich Theorem
#@Donald E. Knuth[167694],
#!This report contains expository notes about a func- tion #(G) that is popularly known as the Lovasz number of a graph G. There are many ways to deflne#(G), and the surpris- ing variety of difierent characterizations indicates in itself that #(G) should be interesting. But the most interesting property of#(G) is probably the fact that it can be computed e-ciently, although it lies \sandwiched" between other classic graph num- bers whose computation is NP-hard. I have tried to make these notes self-contained so that they might serve as an elementary introduction to the growing literature on Lovasz's fascinating function.

#*an Asynchronous Data-Parallel Language for Irregular Algorithms
#@Emmanuel Melin[407429],Bruno Raffin[428046],Xavier Rebeuf[327573],Bernard Virot[230198],
#!Parallelism suffers from a lack of programming lan- guages both simple to handle and able to take advantage of the power of present parallel computers. If parallelism ex- pression is too high level, compilers have to perform com- plex optimizations leading often to poor performances. One the other hand, too low level parallelism transfers difficul - ties toward the programmer. In this paper, we propose a new programming language that integrates both a synchronous data-parallel program- ming model and an asynchronous execution model. The syn- chronous data-parallel programming model allows a safe program designing. The asynchronous execution model yields an efficient execution on present MIMD architectures without any program transformation. Our language re- lies on a logical instruction ordering exploited by specific send/receive communications. It allows to express only the effective data dependences between processors. This abili ty is enforced by a possible send/receive unmatching useful fo r irregular algorithms. A sparse vector computation exempli - fies our language potentialities.

#%!Completion Completion has recently been put in a more abstract framework [ Bachmair-et al, 1986 ] , an approach we adopt here. As in traditional proof theory (cf. [ Takeuti, 1987 ] ), proofs are reduced, in some well-founded sense, by replacing locally maximal subproofs with smaller ones, until a normal-form proof is obtained. In completion, the axioms used are in a constant ...

#%!this paper, we got informed of the work of G. Salzer, which has beendone independently from ours [6]. He uses a quite different formalism, but he shows essentiallythe same results as ours, except that his formalism is slightly more powerful since he can expressfor example the set of all complete finite binary trees with internal nodes labeled with f . Indeed,...

#%n28
#%@Catherine Delor[55302710],Laurence Puel[1870172],
#%!In this paper, we give a generalization of the associative path ordering. This ordering has been introduced by Bachmair and Plaisted [5] and is a restricted variant of the recursive path ordering which can be used for proving the termination of associative-commutative term rewriting systems. This ordering requires strong conditions on the precedence on the alphabet. In this article, ...

#%*Functional programing and the logical variable[566726]
#%n18
#%@Gary Lindstrom[1741396],
#%!Logic programming offers a variety of computational effects which go beyond those customarily found in functional programming languages. Among these effects is the notion of the “logical variable.” i.e. a value determined by the intersection of constraints, rather than by direct binding. We argue that this concept is “separable” from logic programming, and can sensibly be incorporated into ...

#%@Deepak Kapur[652279],G. Sivakumar[227659],Hantao Zhang[1414970],
#%!A new method, which extends the lexicographic recursive path ordering of Dershowitz and Kamin and Levy, to prove termination of associative-commutative (AC) rewrite systems is proposed. Instead of comparing the arguments of an AC-operator using the multiset extension, we partition them into disjoint subsets and each subset is used only once for comparison. To preserve transitivity, we introduce ...

#%!Fay has described in [2,3] a complete T-unification for equational theories T which possess a complete set of reductions as defined by Knuth & Bendix [12]. This algorithm relies essentially on using the narrowing process defined by Lankford [13]. In this paper, we first study the relations between narrowing and unification and we give a new version of ...

We then discussvarious strategies of narrowing. Finally we explain how to simulate thesestrategies of narrowing using the leftmost SLD-resolution rule of Prolog, andcompare some experimental results with those obtained with ...
